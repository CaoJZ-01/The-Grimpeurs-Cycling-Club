# Android Project: GCC Cycling Mobile Application
The Grimpeurs Cycling Club (GCC) App is a specialized mobile application that serves as a hub for all things cycling-related, including event coordination, registration, route tracking, and community engagement.

## Deliverable 1
In deliverable 1, we implement the user account management component. That is, the app needs to allow users to create user accounts.

There is a single admin account (username: admin, pwd: admin), and it is possible to create as many clubs and participants as desired.
Once the user logs in, they will see a second screen with the following message, ‘Welcome firstname! You are logged in as “role”. 

We use Firebase as DB support.

## Deliverable 2
In deliverable 2, we implement the Admin-related functionality. The app allows admin users to add, edit and delete event types that can be offered by cycling clubs using the application.

Additionally, the admin account is able to delete cycling club accounts and participant accounts. A cycling club is managed by a single owner. 

## Deliverable 3
In this deliverable, we implement the cycling club-related functionality. The app is able to allow club owners to complete the club profile and associate their club to the set of predefined and available types of events (that were created by the admin).

## Deliverable 4
In this deliverable, we implement the participant-related functionality. The app allows participants to search for a cycling club, type of event or specific event. The application can display the list of cycling clubs organizing such events.
